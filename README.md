This script allows you to organize and keep your non-installer program files in a dedicated folder for easier and tidier access to executables. The script copies all files from the user-specified location and moves them to a folder in your profile. In addition, it creates a shortcut on your desktop so you can quickly access your program.


## Compatibility üóÉ

- This script only works on Windows
- Tested on version ``1809`` of Windows 10, *although any previous or next version should not give problems.*
- You must run it as administrator.

## How to use it ‚ùì
1. Run the script as admin, in any folder.
2. Enter the program folder like: ```C:\program\path```
3. Finally the name of the executable ```MyExe.exe```

#### Warnings ‚ö†
- The folder path must not end with a backslash.
- If the path contains spaces, surround it with double quotes to ensure it is correctly recognized.
- The name of the executable file must match the one in the folder exactly, including the file extension (.exe).
- The file extension must be .exe for the path to be recognized correctly.
- The nickname for the program should be unique and not used for any other purpose.

***All of these conditions will be fixed over time.***
